/**
 * @module tests/run-worker-shard-retry
 * @description CAP-002 Phase 2 — Prerequisite #3 coverage.
 *
 * Verifies that the retry-reset path in `backend/src/workers/runWorker.js`
 * is shard-scoped: when one shard of a multi-shard run hits a non-final
 * BullMQ retry, only that shard's results get wiped — sibling shards that
 * already completed must keep their persisted results so a single shard's
 * transient failure doesn't erase three other shards' worth of work.
 *
 * The retry-reset filter is a pure expression — it's the only piece of the
 * catch block that's interesting to test in isolation. The surrounding
 * machinery (BullMQ retry semantics, abort detection, attempt-counter
 * arithmetic) is already covered by `run-worker.test.js` via its
 * `simulateCatchBlock` helper. This file extends that idea with a tiny
 * `shardScopedRetryReset` fixture that mirrors the production filter at
 * `runWorker.js` precisely:
 *
 *   - `isNonExecutedSkip` rows always survive (AUTO-001 / AUTO-004 contract)
 *   - `shardIndex == null` → legacy wipe-all (every execution row dropped)
 *   - `shardIndex === N` → keep rows where `_shardIndex !== N` (sibling shards)
 *
 * Importing `isNonExecutedSkip` from the real module keeps the test
 * honest — if a future skip kind is added to `skipReasons.js` it'll
 * automatically be preserved here too, matching the production behaviour.

/**
 * Thin wrapper around the production shared filter at

 * helper is the single source of truth; this wrapper just shapes the
 * result into the `{ results, passed, failed }` form the assertions read.
